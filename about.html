          <p><span class="firstLetter">M</span><span>y name is <span class="italic">Mars</span>, and I live in <span class="italic">Kiev</span>. My first home was a place with rubbish all around. It was stinky, so I had to not take shower at all. After such exteme measures, my health went down, and I felt very sick. It is exactly the time when <span class="italic">2 hoomans</span> found me and treated. Right now, I leave with them, and I am very happy. I can eat a lot. I can sleep a lot. And I can even meow.</span></p>
          <p><span class="firstLetter">M</span><span>y life as a cat is pretty comfortable but for the moments when I am cuddled too hard. <span class="bold">I hate those</span>. However, I need to endure the pain and suffering because I am treated like that only by those who helped me when I was in need. The rest of people...meh...I am afraid of them.</span></p>
          <p><span class="firstLetter">M</span><span>y plans for the future are simple: I will hunt as many flies as I can, I will eat as much food as I can, and I will sleep as much as I can. This is a simple truth of being a cat. If you are hooman and like this lifestyle - your inner cat is way too strong.</span></p>
